              <h3>Why study in the UK?</h3>
              <p>
                The UK and its universities have an undisputed reputation for
                academic excellence and quality with thousands of courses
                available for students, as well as being an ideal destination
                for many decades for over a million international students from
                all over the world. There are a variety of reasons why you
                should consider studying in the UK. Some of these reasons might
                be exclusively academic for you, but in addition to the
                high-quality education, you will gain a lot of value from this
                one-of-a-kind experience, if you choose to study in the UK.
                Furthermore, in comparison to the level of education offered to
                you, British universities are more affordable. There’s much more
                you need to know if you’re asking yourself why should I study in
                the UK. Let’s take a look.
              </p>
              <h2>Academic Benefits</h2>
              <h3>Your Education Will Be Recognized Wherever You Go</h3>
              <p>
                The academic benefits are probably the main reason why studying
                in the UK could be the best decision you can take in your life.
                If you decide to get your education in the UK, your degree will
                be recognized and respected, no matter where you end up being
                employed. The education will provide you with a solid foundation
                and boost your potential for having a higher salary and finding
                exactly the job you want. Every British university is recognized
                worldwide for having creative and challenging environments that
                help their students push themselves to the extreme. Their
                standards are incredibly high, and year after year, the
                universities are tested for how well they are meeting modern
                challenges. The higher education system in the UK has been the
                basis for higher education standards in other countries for
                years.

              <h3>You Can Study Any Course Of Desire</h3>
              <p>
                The UK has countless high education institutions, and almost
                every single one of them has opportunities for international
                students to study there. You can choose from a variety of
                different undergraduate and graduate degrees, and combine your
                courses in order to make a degree program that suits your needs
                and interests. British schools have a rich history and tradition
                of providing a world-class education to their students. There
                are many universities people have heard of even without any
                prior research on why studying in the UK is a magnificent
                opportunity. Oxford and Cambridge are names that are known
                throughout the world because of their high-quality courses and
                devotion to education quality and performance. But the UK has a
                limitless number of universities where you can reach the same
                exact top quality education. You can find literally any course
                you want in the UK, and you will find at least one (likely more)
                schools that will help you excel in your area of expertise.

              <h3>You’ll Get The Skills You Need to Succeed</h3>
              <p>
                In today’s world economy, you need specific skills and qualities
                to be able to succeed in your field. Employers want high-quality
                employees who have specific skill sets, including effective,
                critical, and creative thinking skills. They also want people
                with a grasp on English – what better way for you to learn
                English than to learn it in the country of its origin? You can
                immerse yourself in and learn to live, work, and think in the
                English language. The learning experience that you will receive
                when you study in the UK is one that will provide you with the
                skills you need. You’ll be encouraged to read, think
                independently, question and analyze what you read and learn. Did
                you know that British scientists and institutions have won
                almost 100 Nobel Prizes? Very few countries can claim that level
                of achievement. People who study art, fashion, film, TV and
                video game design are considered among the best in the world.

              <h3>
                Why studying in the UK is a perfect option for international
                students
              </h3>
              <p>
                The UK is one of the most popular countries to travel to for the
                purpose of earning an education. Generations of international
                students have come to the UK for their education, which means
                that British universities have decades of experience in working
                with international students. In other words, you’ll get the red
                carpet treatment from the time you start applying until you walk
                across the stage for your degree. There are two major
                organizations that can help you find out what you need to do in
                order to study in the UK as an international student. The
                British Council can work with you on every aspect of applying to
                university, find which university fits your needs, and get ready
                to come to study in the UK. The Universities and Colleges
                Admissions Service can also help you to apply to institutions
                across the UK as well. After you’ve been accepted, your
                university will treat you well. Many institutions help you get
                from the airport to your living accommodation, and some even
                guarantee living accommodations for the first year you are
                there. Every university has an international student society
                that will help you become adjusted to life in the UK and connect
                you with other international students. One important thing to
                also mention is that many UK universities are also LGBT
                friendly, and you will never feel marginalized if you belong to
                this community.

              <h3>Work opportunities</h3>
              <p>
                Currently, the competition in the job market is tougher than
                ever before. To be able to survive you must be equipped with
                top-level skills. What’s the best way of achieving this, except
                attending a top quality education? And what’s better than being
                able to cover all higher tuitions and other living expenses
                these places carry along entirely on your own? Knowing the
                financial struggles foreign students usually face abroad, this
                is why studying in the UK should be your top option. If you want
                to seek an excellent higher education at the smallest price or
                dream of free education, you’re actually far from reality. In
                modern times, one without the other is pretty impossible.
                Indeed, the UK is a particular example of this. No matter which
                university you choose to study in the UK it will cost you quite
                a lot. But there’s no need to worry. The good news is that, by
                contrast to the most popular study destinations, in the UK
                you’re allowed to work while studying. During the regular
                academic year, you’re permitted to work part-time up to 20 hours
                per week. When the academic year is over you can seek a
                full-time job. Apparently, you’ll be able to cover all tuition
                fees and living expenses entirely on our own. At the same time,
                working during your studies will give you a real independence
                feeling so you will learn to lean on your own self. Even better,
                if you show a higher level of commitment and results during your
                studies you can receive many offers from employers and
                eventually remain in the UK after university is over. However,
                there are certain conditions you need to fulfill to achieve this
                opportunity. Firstly, you must have an offer from an employer. A
                British degree can extra boost your employability and help you
                to get a visa for staying after you finish university. Second,
                your eligibility for such visa may be conditioned by a certain
                minimum salary. Years after you can switch your visa to become a
                permanent British citizen. Again a certain minimum limit of your
                salary may be required, for example, £35,000 per year. You
                wouldn’t be the first and the last one to have this destiny
                because many have had this luck. Knowing this will help you
                remove any doubt you may have to study in the UK.

              <h2>Financial Benefits</h2>
              <h3>British Universities are Affordable</h3>
              <p>
                UK degrees take less time to attain than degrees in other
                countries. Where other countries take at least four years for an
                undergraduate degree and two or three years for a postgraduate
                degree; in the UK only takes three years for an undergraduate
                degree, and one year for a postgraduate (unless you are in
                research, then it may take 18 months to 2 years). That means
                that you are spending less money overall. On top of that, there
                is a lot of “free money” (scholarships, grants, and bursaries)
                available from British universities or certain institutions that
                are just for international students. Over 20,000 international
                students also get other financial aid from the UK government,
                and you can work while you’re studying in the UK as well.
              </p>
              <h3>The Cost Of Living is Reasonable</h3>
              <p>
                If you were asked about your top reasons for living and studying
                in the UK, you would probably mention the cost of living. We
                discuss the cost of living in another article, but as you will
                be able to see, it’s fairly reasonable to live in England.
                Obviously, it will cost a bit more if you live in a city like
                London, but in general, costs are reasonable. You’ll want to do
                research before you come, though, in order to learn more about
                the cost of living in your particular area. The cost of living
                also includes health care, and in the UK, that’s not much of a
                worry at all. The UK is one of the countries which has an
                institutionalized, national health care system, which will
                reduce your overall health care costs. In another one of our
                articles, we explore the National Health Service (NHS) and how
                that can help you stay healthy during the time you study in the
                UK.

              <h2>Other Benefits</h2>
              <h3>The UK Has a Unique Culture</h3>
              <p>
                The UK is quite a unique country. Thousands of families from
                around the world have decided to live in the UK, which gives it
                a rich, multicultural atmosphere that you cannot find anywhere
                else in the world. Every year, over 200,000 international
                students decide to study only in England, while the number of
                them choosing to study in the UK is even bigger. In the UK
                you’ll encounter a diverse community. You’ll get to mix and meet
                people throughout the world, and your experience will be even
                richer because of being able to interact with so many different
                types of people. You’ll get insights into other countries and
                cultures, and learn a lot more than you may have been able to in
                your home country. The UK isn’t just unique because of its
                cosmopolitan flair, though. The UK holds a rich, interesting
                history that makes it an ideal place for people of all
                backgrounds. Commerce is also immense in cities like London. The
                nightlife is varied all over the country, and there is always
                something to do. Art galleries, concerts, open-air markets, and
                pubs are popular places for the English to congregate and enjoy
                themselves. If you decide to study in UK, you will never be
                bored, there is always something new to do, and there are always
                new people to meet.
              </p>
              <h3>The UK is the Gateway to The Rest of Europe</h3>
              <p>
                If you want to travel Europe, the UK is the place to be. In the
                United Kingdom alone, you can travel to England, Scotland,
                Wales, and Northern Ireland and learn about the different
                backgrounds and lifestyles in each country. Public
                transportation makes it simple to travel the entire United
                Kingdom and take in the sights and sounds. As a student, you can
                receive special rates for transportation when you buy monthly
                passes. Those same public transportation routes can be utilized
                to reach the rest of Europe. The Chunnel (English Channel
                Tunnel) can take you right into mainland Europe within a day.
                You can obtain public transportation passes for the countries
                close to the UK, and you can explore wherever you want on the
                continent. Just make sure you have the necessary paperwork to do
                so (passports), and take the time you’ll have on weekends and
                long breaks in order to take in the sights and sounds of the
                rest of mainland Europe. A world-class education in a
                multicultural world can help to make you ready for the life that
                you will have after university. And it really helps that you
                will be able to enjoy UK and Europe in a unique way that you
                couldn’t anywhere else. Now that you’ve taken a look, why won’t
                you consider to study in the UK in your near future? Check out
                more of the resources on this page in order to get what you need

              <h3>The UK student visa</h3>
              <p>
                In order to be able to stay in the UK as an international
                student, you must have a student visa. To some extent getting a
                student visa in the UK is easier than in different countries.
                Student visa in the UK is called Tier4 visa. There are two types
                of Tier4 visas: Tier4 (General) – For students Tier4 (Child) –
                children aged 4 to 17
